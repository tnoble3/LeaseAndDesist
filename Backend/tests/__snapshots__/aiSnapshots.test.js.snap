Keep costs low.\n- If an occasion is provided, theme the event around it; otherwise keep it season-neutral.\n- Do not suggest personal practice plans, 30-day challenges, journaling, or solo tasks—only shared events that people host or attend.\n- Keep titles short and avoid words like \"challenge\" or \"task\" in the title.\n- Respond with a JSON object only:\n{\n  \"title\": \"short event title (max 70 chars)\",\n  \"description\": \"2-3 sentences with what happens, who participates, materials, and the community benefit\"\n}",

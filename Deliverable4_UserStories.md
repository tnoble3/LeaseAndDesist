This file lists the user stories originally required for Deliverable 4

## Deliverable 4 — User Stories

1. As a renter, I want to securely log into the app, so that I can access my rent and maintenance information without exposing personal data.
2. As a renter, I want to be able to anonymously report any complaints I have.
3. As a renter, I want to view my rent history and upcoming due dates, so that I can better
manage my budget.
4. As a renter, I want to upload and access important documents like my lease, so that I have
everything stored in one place.
5. As a renter, I want to join a community discussion board, so that I can share experiences
and learn from other tenants.

Each of the above features is implemented across the Backend and Frontend directories and includes tests and (where appropriate) e2e coverage.
